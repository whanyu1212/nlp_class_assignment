Tivozanib, had received a complete  response letter (CRL) from the FDA in Jun 2013 for the first-line treatment of advanced RCC, citing concerns regarding the  negative trend in overall survival in the pivotal phase III study. We note that the company is currently conducting the TIVO-3 study  on tivozanib to address the concerns raised by the regulatory agency in its CRL. Timely approval would have allowed the  company to start generating revenues from tivozanib.  In January 2019, AVEO faced a major setback when it had to delay its NDA, seeking an approval for Fotivda. The company  decided not to file an NDA in the United States after the FDA informed that it was not satisfied with the preliminary OS data  reported along with the top-line TIVO-3 study data on progression-free-survival last November. The phase III TIVO-3 study  evaluated Fotivda in highly refractory advanced or metastatic RCC patients compared with Bayer AG?€?s Nexavar. Previously, the  company intended to submit the NDA in the first half of 2019. AVEO had planned a final analysis of OS last August. Data from  this interim analysis will be available during the fourth quarter of 2019.  Meanwhile, AVEO does not plan to conduct further studies on tivozanib for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer till the  time an assay used to measure serum neuropilin-1 in first-line colorectal cancer patients is identified. We note that the phase II  BATON breast cancer study on tivozanib was stopped due to insufficient enrollment. Meanwhile, a phase II study that evaluated  ficlatuzumab in combination with Iressa for the treatment of first-line non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated  disappointing results. Based on the findings from the interim analysis and slow enrollment, AVEO and Biodesix discontinued the  phase II FOCAL study that was conducted to evaluate ficlatuzumab in combination with Tarceva in the subset of patients with  first-line advanced NSCLC in September 2016.

The study is evaluating patients with recurrent or metastatic RCC, who have failed at least two prior  regimens including VEGFR-TKI therapy (other than Nexavar). In Feb 2017, AVEO announced that TIVO-3, to compare lead  candidate tivozanib to Nexavar in patients with refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), has successfully completed the first  safety review by Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). The committee ruled no safety concern was observed for tivozanib and  recommended that the study can replace the small number of patients who dropped out prior to starting treatment.

The stock has rallied 16.2% compared with the industry's increase of 2.3%.  Rubraca Holds Potential in Ovarian Cancer:  Rubraca is not only the first approved  product in  Clovis?€?  portfolio but also has bright prospects given the immense  commercial potential in the target market and the tremendous demand for PARP  inhibitors.  In  January  2019,  the  European  Commission  approved  Rubraca  in  maintenance setting based on data from the ARIEL-3 study. With the expanded label as  well as expansion in Europe, the commercial uptake of the drug is likely to improve.  Moreover, the company is conducting patient-focused awareness programs for Rubraca as well as PARP inhibitors. These  programs helped the company to increase the PARP inhibitor market and its share in it, boosting Rubraca?€?s sales.  Clovis is evaluating Rubraca in several label expansion studies. A phase III confirmatory study - ARIEL4 is evaluating Rubraca  versus chemotherapy in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. A phase III study ?€? ATHENA ?€? is evaluating Rubraca in  combination with Bristol-Myers?€? Opdivo, as part of collaboration, in advanced ovarian cancer.  Additional Indications Being Evaluated:  Meanwhile, Clovis is looking to expand Rubraca?€?s label into additional cancer types like  prostrate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers, among others. A phase II TRITON2 study and a phase III TRITON 3 study is  evaluating Rubraca in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with tumor with BRCA mutations and ATM  mutations. The FDA granted Orphan drug status to the drug for this indication in October 2018. The company plans to file for label  expansion of Rubraca in prostate cancer in late 2019. The company is also developing the drug as monotherapy or in combination  with other therapies for lung, bladder, pancreatic and gastroesophageal cancer.  Clovis has a collaboration agreement with Merck and Bristol-Myers to develop Rubraca in combination with their PD-1/ PDL1  inhibitors for treating several cancer indications.  Apart from Rubraca, the company is also developing lucitanib for treating breast and lung cancer. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the  company expanded its agreement with Bristol-Myers to include combination studies of lucitanib. The company?€?s partner, Servier,  returned ex-U.S. (excluding China) rights to the candidate in 2018. Now, Clovis owns global development rights for lucitanib, except  China. The company has plans to initiate clinical studies in the first half of 2019 to evaluate lucitanib in combination with Rubraca or  a PD-1 inhibitor.  Potential in the Target Market:  According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among  women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. It is estimated that more than 22,530  cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. With standard-of-care treatments for ovarian cancer  including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted and hormone therapies, the five-year relative survival rate for all types of  ovarian cancer is 45%. There is huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have  a germline or somatic BRCA mutation. Therefore, Rubraca has bright prospects given the immense commercial potential of the  target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Moreover, there will be 174,650 newly diagnosed prostate cancer  patients in the United Stated in 2019, per the American Cancer Society. According to the National Cancer Institute, 80,470 patients  will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2019. ",buy

Rubraca Approval was a Boost:  Clovis got a boost with the accelerated FDA approval of  Rubraca in Dec 2016 for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. The  approval came more than two months ahead of schedule. The FDA was expected to  render a final decision on Rubraca by Feb 23, 2017. The approval was based on the  encouraging objective response rate and duration of response.  Rubraca is not only the first approved product in Clovis?€? portfolio, but also has bright prospects given the immense commercial  potential in the target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Successful commercialization will significantly boost  Clovis?€?  top line, going forward. Meanwhile, Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a comparable ovarian cancer indication.  Clovis expects an approval in EU in late 2017 or early 2018 and is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.  In order to convert the accelerated approval to a continued approval, Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies including ARIEL3 and  ARIEL4.  Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the ARIEL3 study were presented in Jun 2017. Data from the  study demonstrated that Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients.The  positive results may expand Rubraca?€?s label, which could improve the commercial uptake of the drug.  Clovis plans to file a regulatory application for label expansion to include a second line or later maintenance treatment for ovarian  cancer in patients who have undergone at least one prior therapy, based on ARIEL3 study, within the next four months.  Meanwhile, the second phase III confirmatory study - ARIEL4 is evaluating Rubraca versus chemotherapy in patients who have  failed two prior lines of therapy.  Additional Indications Being Evaluated:  Meanwhile, Clovis is looking to expand Rubraca?€?s  label into additional indications like  prostrate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers, among others. A phase II TRITON2 study in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate  cancer (mCRPC) patients with tumor with BRCA mutations and ATM mutations (both inclusive of germline and somatic) or other  deleterious mutations in other homologous recombination repair genes and all patients will have progressed after receiving one line  of taxane-based chemotherapy and one or two lines of androgen-receptor (AR) targeted therapy in the castrate-resistant setting is  enrolling patients. A phase III comparative study (TRITON  in mCRPC BRCA mutant and ATM mutant (both inclusive of germline  and somatic) patients who have progressed on AR-targeted therapy and who have not yet received chemotherapy in the castrate-  resistant setting is also open for enrolment.  Other ongoing studies include the cooperative group-sponsored MITO-25 study evaluating rucaparib and bevacizumab in  combination as a first-line maintenance therapy for advanced ovarian cancer; the investigator-initiated RUBY study in women with  breast cancer whose tumors have a somatic BRCA mutation or homologous recombination deficient (HRD) signature other than a  known germline BRCA mutation; and the investigator-initiated PLATFORM study in gastroesophageal cancer in the first-line  maintenance setting.

It is estimated that more than 22,240  cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2018. With standard-of-care treatments for ovarian cancer  including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted and hormone therapies, the five-year relative survival rate for all types of  ovarian cancer is 45%. There is huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have  a germline or somatic BRCA mutation. Therefore, Rubraca has bright prospects given the immense commercial potential of the  target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors.

Although Clovis is developing the drug for several  indications beyond ovarian cancer, it will face competition upon successful development and launch in those indications too.  Lynparza, one of its competitors, is already approved for breast cancer and has successfully completed a late-stage study  targeting pancreatic cancer.   Pipeline Setbacks:  In April 2019, Clovis discontinued phase II ATLAS study evaluating Rubraca monotherapy for metastatic  bladder cancer as preliminary data suggested that it was unlikely to provide a meaningful clinical benefit to patients. In the second  quarter of 2016, Clovis received a CRL for the NDA for rociletinib, which was submitted during the third quarter of 2015.

Clovis expects an approval in EU in late 2017 or early 2018 and is establishing the commercial infrastructure for the same.  In order to convert the accelerated approval to a continued approval, Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies including ARIEL3 and  ARIEL4.  Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the ARIEL3 study were presented in Jun 2017. Data from the  study demonstrated that Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients.The  positive results may expand Rubraca?€?s label, which could improve the commercial uptake of the drug.  Clovis plans to file a regulatory application for label expansion to include a second line or later maintenance treatment for ovarian  cancer in patients who have undergone at least one prior therapy, based on ARIEL3 study, within the next four months.

The company has plans to initiate clinical studies in the first half of 2019 to evaluate lucitanib in combination with Rubraca or  a PD-1 inhibitor.  Potential in the Target Market:  According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among  women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. It is estimated that more than 22,530  cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. With standard-of-care treatments for ovarian cancer  including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted and hormone therapies, the five-year relative survival rate for all types of  ovarian cancer is 45%. There is huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have  a germline or somatic BRCA mutation. Therefore, Rubraca has bright prospects given the immense commercial potential of the  target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Moreover, there will be 174,650 newly diagnosed prostate cancer  patients in the United Stated in 2019, per the American Cancer Society. According to the National Cancer Institute, 80,470 patients  will be diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2019. ",buy

The company has plans to initiate clinical studies in the first half of 2019 to evaluate lucitanib in combination with Rubraca or  a PD-1 inhibitor.  Potential in the Target Market:  According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among  women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. It is estimated that more than 22,530  cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2019. With standard-of-care treatments for ovarian cancer  including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted and hormone therapies, the five-year relative survival rate for all types of  ovarian cancer is 45%. There is huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have  a germline or somatic BRCA mutation. Therefore, Rubraca has bright prospects given the immense commercial potential of the  target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. Moreover, there will be 174,650 newly diagnosed prostate cancer  patients in the United Stated in 2019, per the American Cancer Society.

Potential in the Target Market:  According to the American Cancer Society, ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among  women, accounting for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. It is estimated that more than 22,440  cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed in the United States this year. With standard-of-care treatments for ovarian cancer including  surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted and hormone therapies, the five-year relative survival for all types of ovarian cancer is  45%. There is huge unmet need for new treatment options, given that one in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or  somatic BRCA mutation.

Rubraca Approval was a Boost:  Clovis got a boost with the accelerated FDA approval of  Rubraca in December 2016 for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutant ovarian  cancer. The approval came more than two months ahead of schedule. The approval  was based on the encouraging objective response rate and duration of response.  Rubraca is not only the first approved product in Clovis?€? portfolio, but also has bright prospects given the immense commercial  potential in the target market and the tremendous demand for PARP inhibitors. With successful commercialization Rubraca is  registering impressive growth, significantly boosting Clovis?€?  top line. Meanwhile, Rubraca is also under review in the EU for a  comparable ovarian cancer indication. Clovis expects an approval in EU in the first quarter of 2018 and is establishing the  commercial infrastructure for the same.  In order to convert the accelerated approval to a continued approval, Clovis is conducting confirmatory studies including ARIEL3 and  ARIEL4.  Promising progression-free survival (PFS) and safety results from the ARIEL3 study were presented in June 2017. Data from the  study demonstrated that Rubraca has a meaningful impact in delaying disease recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer. Clovis filed a  regulatory application in October 2017 for label expansion to include a second line or later maintenance treatment for advanced  ovarian cancer in patients who have undergone at least one prior therapy, based on ARIEL3 study.

The demand for  these key areas are likely to continue for the next several years as more and more  organizations are trying to take advantage of cloud computing and data analytics in  order to make greater use of their IT infrastructure. With its world-class capabilities in  empowering digital technologies, EPAM is well positioned to grab the growing  opportunities in the aforementioned IT services space.  Acquisitions  have been one of the key growth strategies for EPAM. Since its stock exchange listing, the company has acquired 10  businesses. Most recently, in March 2018, the company bought Boston-based design firm ?€? Continuum. The acquisition brings a  massive talent pool of 150 persons and is expected to contribute approximately $30 million to EPAM?€?s 2018 total revenues. These  acquisitions have enabled EPAM to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio. Moving ahead, such acquisitions  are expected to contribute significantly to the company?€?s revenue stream.  The latest forecast for  worldwide IT spending  by Gartner provides optimism to EPAM?€?s growth prospects. The research firm  expects worldwide IT spending will reach $3.74 trillion in 2018, representing a 6.2% increase from the $3.52 billion recorded last  year. Per Gartner, there are 10 markets driving digital transformation, thereby boosting overall IT spending. These include three  cloud segments infrastructure-as-a-service [IaaS], integrated platform-as-a- service [iPaas] and communications platform-as-a-  service [cPaaS]) ?€? range from technologies that enhance the digital workplace, such as workstream collaboration, workforce  analytics and video message-oriented middleware (MOM), to security (endpoint detection and response), analytics (smart data  discovery) and storage (in-memory data grids). All are tied to enabling and enhancing an enterprise's digital transformation efforts.  All these encourage us about the company?€?s near-term prospects.  EPAM?€?s  strategy of  enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships  with the likes of Amazon Web  Services and Google Cloud is a step in the right direction, as evident from the recent forecast provided by several independent  research firms. The research firm ?€? Gartner ?€? predicts that the public cloud services market will witness a compounded annual  growth rate (CAGR) of 18.4% during the 2018-2021 period, reaching $302.54 billion by 2021 end. Exponential growth in the amount  of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to  cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the rising need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect EPAM?€?s  investments in this space to propel long-term growth.  EPAM has a  strong balance sheet with ample liquidity position  and meagre debt obligations. It should be noted that the  company has been able to regularly increase its cash and cash equivalents balance, which reached $583 million at the end of 2017  from $118 million at the end of 2012. Similarly, EPAM?€?s cash from operations amounted to approximately $195 million in 2017, a  significant increase from $48 million in 2012.

In the first quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew 51%  year over year to $7.9 billion while mobile ad revenues were up 58% to $6.7 billion.  Most importantly, average price per ad increased 14% from the year-ago quarter.  Moreover, ad impressions grew 32%, due to increases in mobile impressions. The  increase in mobile advertisement stems from the fact that mobile ads have far more ad  recall value than other mediums. Since marketers are moving to mobile to target  customers, Facebook is enthusiastically monetizing this shift.  Facebook is aggressively promoting ?€?Live?€? in  order to boost its top line. It intends to  capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media  platforms. Earlier, Facebook had mentioned that video was emerging as a ?€?megatrend?€?  on the same lines like mobile. Moreover,  Facebook is exploring ways to enhance video content ecosystem. It has been investing in original content and said that it will keep  doing the same this year as well. Last year, it signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for  its live platform and added a plethora of new features to Facebook live.  These include enabling broadcast for a Group or Event and  at the same time allowing audience to respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Online video is the most  lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based substitutes,  Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Given the phenomenal growth in  mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook has vastly outperformed the broader market. Over the past one year, shares of  Facebook have grown 31.20% compared with the Zacks Internet Services Industry's gain of 22.85%.  However, CEO Mark  Zuckerberg said that in order to curb the menace of posting of violent videos on Facebook Live, the company is now appointing over  3K people to its Community Operations Team to better handle the review process.  After opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers last year,  Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow  for Facebook.  Again there were no exact numbers with regard to contribution from Instagram but Facebook had earlier said the platform had over  500,000 advertisers. The company is now revamping its feed, so that stories that users care about are displayed first, thereby  improving experience. It has expanded Dynamic ads to Instagram while adding features like Live and Boomerang to Stories.  Instagram boasts over 600 million MAUs and over 400 million DAUs. To bring more advertisers, Facebook said it has unveiled new  tools to promote posts and evaluate business performance directly within Instagram. Facebook also added that its latest feature  ?€?Stories?€?  on Instagram has 200 million daily actives. In Jan 2017, Facebook said it will insert ads in Stories. Notably, Facebook was  subjected to severe ridicule when it acquired the snazzy photo sharing app in 2012 for $1 billion.  Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus are the other extremely prized possessions . Facebook is aggressively working on  monetizing the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ?€?conversational commerce?€? are likely to be the strategies  for Messenger and WhatsApp. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the Messenger app, which has over 1 billion users,  to developers for creating chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. Chatbots is the  new buzz word in the tech space. Chatbots could serve as a powerful strategy to monetize the platform. The  WhatsApp  acquisition  (  not only expanded the company?€?s mobile product line-up but also added a user base, which is predominantly young. At the  same time, the acquisition eliminated Facebook?€?s fastest-growing competitor in terms of user additions. With an estimated user  base of over 1.2 billion, it remains one of most important businesses. To monetize the platform, the company has dropped the  subscription fees and will eventually bring ?€?conversational commerce?€? to the platform.   Oculus  will fuel the company?€?s ambitious  AR/VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another $250 million investment  to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset  with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it had launched its VR headset, Rift. AI and AR/VR technology are fast emerging as  lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market will grow to a whopping  143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion.Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two separate units. While  one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. The company has roped in Hugo Barra  to spearhead its VR efforts as well as head Oculus. Plus, few days back, Facebook said it will be spending over $3 billion in the next  10 years on VR.  Facebook has a  strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow , which makes it an attractive stock for investors. The  company has cash and cash equivalents of $32.3 billion and recorded robust cash flow from operations of over $5.1 billion in the  first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow amounted to nearly $3.8 billion. The company continues to invest in developing its platform and  products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product development  and acquisitions in the future.  Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover?€?s advantage in this  market. The company?€?s  user base  continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve  engagement. But as developed regions mature, Facebook has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South  East Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Free Basics Initiative, which involves partnerships with local telecom networks to subsidize  some basic Internet services (including Facebook) so users can get them free or at nominal rates is expanding its presence in these  emerging regions. Africa, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has a little over 120 million who use Facebook. This clearly indicates  the immense scope for growth in the region even though it might take a lot of time. Also, the lack of physical infrastructure has  propelled the increasing use of mobile Internet in the region, which is in tune with Facebook?€?s growth strategy. Facebook has  collaborated with France-based Eutelsat Communications to launch a satellite that would beam Internet in sub-Saharan African  regions.

As  far as connectivity speeds are concerned, Facebook said that it has broken a few records. In case of wireless transfers, the  company has achieved a point-to-point data rate of 36 Gbps over 13 km with MMW technology and 80 Gbps using the optical cross-  link technology. We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook?€?s user-base in these regions in the long run.  Of all places,  India  deserves special mention in terms of user growth. The world?€?s  second largest populated country offers  tremendous potential. The number of mobile Internet users in the country, which has nearly 1.4 billion people, was 456 million in  December 2017. Per IAMAI report, given the availability of cheaper smartphones, faster connectivity and affordable services, the  figure is estimated to reach 478 million by June 2018.

160,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1(3).pdf",FB,3/9/2018,"Facebook maintains a  cautious stance  on revenue growth. The last reported quarter was no different. Since the past few  quarters, the company has maintained that ad revenues will continue to grow but will now face tougher year-over-year  comparisons. Ad load, which, so far has been a leading factor driving ad revenues, will now cease to be so in the coming quarters  and won?€?t be a big factor post 2017. Moreover, as the company continues to ramp up investments (Video, AR/VR and AI), costs  are already on the rise. Also, in the light of the recent Russia ads debacle, Facebook has said it will invest significantly in ramping  up security on the platform which will weigh down on the margins. Facebook planning to go on a hiring spree next year, especially  engineers and people involved in maintaining safety and security.   Facebook currently faces  stiff competition  from other big and small social media players. Although the company has started  distributing ads on other websites, we believe that Google continues to have a significant competitive edge due to its scale and  diversified product offering. Advertising remains Facebook?€?s major source of revenues and increasing competition can hurt its  top-line growth, going forward. New social media services like Snapchat and Pinterest offer tough competition as far as user  growth (especially teenagers) is concerned.   Although Facebook has significant growth opportunities in the emerging countries of South-East Asia and Africa, low internet  penetration in these regions may negatively affect its expansion. Further, while the company can be accessed from Hong Kong,  its usage has been  restricted  in mainland China due to excessive government regulations and censorship. This limits its growth  opportunities in the Asian region (Facebook?€?s fastest growing user base in terms of geography). The company is experiencing  better growth in international markets than in the U.S. However, average revenue per user (ARPU) is significantly low in these  regions compared with the U.S.   As Facebook hosts a huge amount of personal data, it has been under  constant scrutiny  from privacy groups and federal  agencies. This huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers. As a result, the company has been criticized for  allegedly selling personal data to advertisers in order to boost its top line. Although the company has denied any wrongdoing, we  believe that increasing scrutiny by regulators on its data handling practices remains a major concern, going forward. Recently, the  company ran into trouble with Brazilian law enforcement agencies involving its messaging service, WhatsApp, and in Germany  over antitrust concerns.  Moreover, Facebook finds itself increasingly at loggerheads with authorities across different countries  like Israel, who accuse the social media giant of repeatedly failing to co-operate with them on extremely sensitive matters.   Facebook will likely be impacted because of the  uncertainties relating to Brexit,  given the fact that it will have to re-define  everything from tax to data flow and privacy regulations for its operation in the U.K. Moreover, the company has its EU  headquarters in Ireland, through which, it was getting certain tax benefits. Now due to Brexit, Facebook will have to chalk out a  way to avoid paying higher taxes. It might also result in it having to relocate its headquarters (and some other facilities as well) in  order to continue getting the benefits of the EU bloc. ",sell

164,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1(4).pdf",FB,7/24/2017,"Facebook  has witnessed  significant  traction  in online and mobile advertising  spending  in a short span of time. In the first quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew 51%  year over year to $7.9 billion while mobile ad revenues were up 58% to $6.7 billion.  Most importantly, average price per ad increased 14% from the year-ago quarter.  Moreover, ad impressions grew 32%, due to increases in mobile impressions. The  increase in mobile advertisement stems from the fact that mobile ads have far more ad  recall value than other mediums. Since marketers are moving to mobile to target  customers, Facebook is enthusiastically monetizing this shift.  Facebook is aggressively promoting ?€?Live?€? in  order to boost its top line. It intends to  capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media  platforms. Earlier, Facebook had mentioned that video was emerging as a ?€?megatrend?€?  on the same lines like mobile. Moreover,  Facebook is exploring ways to enhance video content ecosystem. It has been investing in original content and said that it will keep  doing the same this year as well. Last year, it signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for  its live platform and added a plethora of new features to Facebook live.  These include enabling broadcast for a Group or Event and  at the same time allowing audience to respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Online video is the most  lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based substitutes,  Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Given the phenomenal growth in  mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook has vastly outperformed the broader market. Over the past one year, shares of  Facebook have grown 35.2% compared with the Zacks Internet Services Industry's gain of 22.6%.  However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg  said that in order to curb the menace of posting of violent videos on Facebook Live, the company is now appointing over 3K people  to its Community Operations Team to better handle the review process.  After opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers last year,  Instagram has emerged as an important cash cow  for Facebook.  Again there were no exact numbers with regard to contribution from Instagram but Facebook had earlier said the platform had over  500,000 advertisers. The company is now revamping its feed, so that stories that users care about are displayed first, thereby  improving experience. It has expanded Dynamic ads to Instagram while adding features like Live and Boomerang to Stories.  Instagram boasts over 700 million MAUs and over 400 million DAUs. To bring more advertisers, Facebook said it has unveiled new  tools to promote posts and evaluate business performance directly within Instagram. Facebook also added that its latest feature  ?€?Stories?€?  on Instagram has 250 million daily actives. In Jan 2017, Facebook said it will insert ads in Stories. Notably, Facebook was  subjected to severe ridicule when it acquired the snazzy photo sharing app in 2012 for $1 billion.  Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus are the other extremely prized possessions . Facebook is aggressively working on  monetizing the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ?€?conversational commerce?€? are likely to be the strategies  for Messenger and WhatsApp. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the Messenger app, which has over 1 billion users,  to developers for creating chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. Chatbots is the  new buzz word in the tech space. Chatbots could serve as a powerful strategy to monetize the platform. The  WhatsApp  acquisition  (  not only expanded the company?€?s mobile product line-up but also added a user base, which is predominantly young. At the  same time, the acquisition eliminated Facebook?€?s fastest-growing competitor in terms of user additions. With an estimated user  base of over 1.2 billion, it remains one of most important businesses. To monetize the platform, the company has dropped the  subscription fees and will eventually bring ?€?conversational commerce?€? to the platform.   Oculus  will fuel the company?€?s ambitious  AR/VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another $250 million investment  to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset  with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it had launched its VR headset, Rift. AI and AR/VR technology are fast emerging as  lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market will grow to a whopping  143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion.Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two separate units. While  one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. The company has roped in Hugo Barra  to spearhead its VR efforts as well as head Oculus. Plus, few days back, Facebook said it will be spending over $3 billion in the next  10 years on VR.  Facebook has a  strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow , which makes it an attractive stock for investors. The  company has cash and cash equivalents of $32.3 billion and recorded robust cash flow from operations of over $5.1 billion in the  first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow amounted to nearly $3.8 billion. The company continues to invest in developing its platform and  products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product development  and acquisitions in the future.  Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover?€?s advantage in this  market. The company?€?s  user base  continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve  engagement. But as developed regions mature, Facebook has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South  East Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Free Basics Initiative, which involves partnerships with local telecom networks to subsidize  some basic Internet services (including Facebook) so users can get them free or at nominal rates is expanding its presence in these  emerging regions. Africa, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has a little over 120 million who use Facebook. This clearly indicates  the immense scope for growth in the region even though it might take a lot of time. Also, the lack of physical infrastructure has  propelled the increasing use of mobile Internet in the region, which is in tune with Facebook?€?s growth strategy. Facebook has  collaborated with France-based Eutelsat Communications to launch a satellite that would beam Internet in sub-Saharan African  regions. It is also testing Express Wi-Fi, and developing laser technology to move loads of data at super fast speed along with  Aquila, a solar powered aircraft to beam Internet from the sky.

Since the past few quarters, the company has maintained that ad  revenues will continue to grow but will now face tougher year-over-year comparisons. Ad load, which so far has been a leading  factor driving ad revenues, will now cease to be so in the coming quarters and won?€?t  be a big factor after mid-2017.  Consequently, ad revenue rates will ?€?come down meaningfully.?€? Moreover, as Facebook continues to ramp up investments,  costs are already on the rise. With Facebook planning to go on a hiring spree next year (especially engineers), it will further add  to costs.   Facebook currently faces   stiff competition  from other big and small social media players. Although the company has started  distributing ads on other websites, we believe that Google continues to have a significant competitive edge due to its scale and  diversified product offering. Advertising remains Facebook?€?s major source of revenues and increasing competition can hurt its  top-line growth, going forward. New social media services like Snapchat and Pinterest offer tough competition as far as user  growth (especially teenagers) is concerned.   Although Facebook has significant growth opportunities in the emerging countries of South-East Asia and Africa, low Internet  penetration in these regions may negatively affect its expansion. Further, while Facebook can be accessed from Hong Kong, its  usage has been  restricted  in mainland China due to excessive government regulations and censorship. This limits its growth  opportunities in the Asian region (Facebook?€?s  fastest growing user base in terms of geography). Moreover, the company is  experiencing better growth in international markets than in the U.S. However, average revenue per user (ARPU) is significantly  low in these regions compared to the U.S. ARPU in the U.S. and Canada was $15.00 compared with $5.00 from Europe, $1.00  from Asia and $1.00 from the Rest of the World.   As Facebook hosts a huge amount of personal data, it has been under  constant scrutiny  from privacy groups and federal  agencies. This huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers. As a result, the company has been criticized for  allegedly selling personal data to advertisers in order to boost its top line. Although the company has denied any wrongdoing, we  believe that increasing scrutiny by regulators on its data handling practices remains a major concern, going forward. Recently, the  company ran into trouble with Brazilian law enforcement agencies involving its messaging service WhatsApp and in Germany  over antitrust concerns.  Moreover, Facebook finds itself increasingly at loggerheads with authorities across different countries  like Israel who accuse the social media giant of repeatedly failing to co-operate with them on extremely sensitive matters.   Facebook will likely be impacted because of the  uncertainties relating to Brexit  given the fact that it will have to re-define  everything from tax to data flow and privacy regulations for its operation in the UK. Moreover, the company has its EU  headquarters in Ireland through which it was getting certain tax benefits. Now as Brexit happens, Facebook will have to chalk out  a way to avoid paying higher taxes. It might also result in it having to relocate its headquarters (and some other facilities as well)  in order to continue getting the benefits of the EU bloc. ",sell

Facebook?€?s is already on a  hiring spree, especially engineers and people involved in maintaining safety and security. This is expected to hurt profitability.   Facebook currently faces stiff competition from other big and small social media players. Although the company has started  distributing ads on other websites, we believe that Google continues to have a significant competitive edge due to its scale and  diversified product offering. Advertising remains Facebook?€?s major source of revenues and increasing competition can hurt its  top-line growth, going forward. Google?€?s  YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest offer tough competition as far as user growth is ",sell
174,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1(6).pdf",FB,8/9/2017,"Facebook  has witnessed  significant  traction  in online and mobile advertising  spending  in a short span of time. In the second quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew  47% year over year to $9.2 billion while mobile ad revenues were up 53% to $8 billion.  Most importantly, average price per ad increased 24% from the year-ago quarter.  Moreover, ad impressions grew 19%, due to increases in mobile impressions. The  increase in mobile advertisement stems from the fact that mobile ads have far more ad  recall value than other mediums. Since marketers are moving to mobile to target  customers, Facebook is enthusiastically monetizing this shift.  Facebook is aggressively promoting  ?€?Live?€?   in order to boost its top line. It intends to  capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media  platforms. Earlier, Facebook had mentioned that video was emerging as a ?€?megatrend?€?  on the same lines like mobile. Last year, it  signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for its live platform and added a plethora of new  features to Facebook live. These include enabling broadcast for a group or event and at the same time allowing the audience to  respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.  As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more  video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Given the phenomenal growth in mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook  has vastly outperformed the broader market. Facebook original programming might go live in mid August, per reports Over the past  one year, shares of Facebook have grown 37.1% compared with the industry's gain of 14.6%.   After opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers last year,  Instagram  has emerged as an important cash cow for Facebook.  Again, there were no exact numbers with regard to contribution from Instagram. It has expanded Dynamic ads to Instagram while  adding features like Live and Boomerang to Stories. The photo-sharing app now boasts over 700 million MAUs and over 400 million  DAUs. To bring more advertisers, Facebook said it has unveiled new tools to promote posts and evaluate business performance  directly within Instagram. The company also added that its latest feature ?€?Stories?€?  on Instagram has 250 million daily actives. In Jan  2017, Facebook said it will insert ads in Stories. Notably, it was subjected to severe ridicule when it acquired the snazzy photo  sharing app in 2012 for $1 billion.  Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus  are the other extremely prized possessions. Facebook is aggressively working on monetizing  the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ?€?conversational  commerce?€? are likely to be the strategies for  Messenger and WhatsApp. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the Messenger app, which has over 1 billion users, to  developers for creating chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. A few weeks  back, management had announced that it will be opening its subsidiary platform, Messenger, to worldwide advertisers, albeit for test  run purpose only. This underscores the company?€?s  efforts to monetize the platform.The  WhatsApp  acquisition (  not only  expanded the company?€?s mobile product lineup but also added a user base, which is predominantly young. At the same time, the  acquisition eliminated Facebook?€?s fastest-growing competitor in terms of user additions. With an estimated user base of over 1.3  billion, it remains one of most important businesses. To monetize the platform, the company has dropped the subscription fees and  will eventually bring ?€?conversational commerce?€? to the platform. WhatsApp now boasts 1 billion daily actives.  Oculus  will fuel the  company?€?s ambitious AR/VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another  $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper  standalone VR headset with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it had launched its VR headset, Rift. AI and AR/VR technology are  fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market will grow  to a whopping 143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion. Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two  separate units. While one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. The company has  roped in Hugo Barra to spearhead its VR efforts as well as head Oculus. Plus, few days back, Facebook said it will be spending over  $3 billion in the next 10 years on VR.  Facebook has a  strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow , which makes it an attractive stock for investors. The  company has cash and cash equivalents of $35.5 billion and recorded robust cash flow from operations of over $5.4 billion in the  second quarter of 2017. Free cash flow amounted to nearly $3.9 billion. The company continues to invest in developing its platform  and products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product  development and acquisitions in the future.  Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover?€?s advantage in this  market. The company?€?s  user base  continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve  engagement. However, as developed regions mature, Facebook has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of  South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Free Basics Initiative, which involves partnerships with local telecom networks to  subsidize some basic Internet services (including Facebook), so that users can get them free or at nominal rates, is expanding its  presence in these emerging regions. Africa, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has a little over 120 million who use Facebook. This  clearly indicates the immense scope for growth in the region even though it might take a lot of time. Also, the lack of physical  infrastructure has propelled the increasing use of mobile internet in the region, which is in tune with Facebook?€?s growth strategy.  Facebook has collaborated with France-based Eutelsat Communications to launch a satellite that would beam internet in sub-  Saharan African regions. It is also testing Express Wi-Fi, and developing laser technology to move loads of data at super-fast speed  along with Aquila, a solar-powered aircraft to beam internet from the sky. At F8 2017 conference, Facebook announced that it is  working on solar-powered drones and MMW technologies. Aquila had a successful second flight. As far as connectivity speeds are  concerned, Facebook said that it has broken a few records. In case of wireless transfers, the company has achieved a point-to-point  data rate of 36 Gbps over 13 km with MMW technology and 80 Gbps using the optical cross-link technology.

At F8 2017 conference,  Facebook announced that it is working on solar-powered drones and MMW technologies. Aquila had a successful second flight. As  far as connectivity speeds are concerned, Facebook said that it has broken a few records. In case of wireless transfers, the  company has achieved a point-to-point data rate of 36 Gbps over 13 km with MMW technology and 80 Gbps using the optical cross-  link technology. We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook?€?s user-base in these regions in the long run.  Of all places,  India  deserves special mention in terms of user growth. The world?€?s  second largest populated country offers  tremendous potential. The number of mobile Internet users in the country, which has nearly 1.4 billion people, was 456 million in  December 2017. Per IAMAI report, given the availability of cheaper smartphones, faster connectivity and affordable services, the  figure is estimated to reach 478 million by June 2018. This bodes well for Facebook as most developed markets have reached  maturity. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine. A burgeoning well-educated middle class,  increasing spending power and rapid adoption of smartphones will boost Facebook?€?s prospects in the country. ",buy

181,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1(8).pdf",FB,9/22/2017,"Facebook  has witnessed  significant  traction  in online and mobile advertising  spending  in a short span of time. In the second quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew  47% year over year to $9.2 billion while mobile ad revenues were up 53% to $8 billion.  Most importantly, average price per ad increased 24% from the year-ago quarter.  Moreover, ad impressions grew 19%, due to increases in mobile impressions. The  increase in mobile advertisement stems from the fact that mobile ads have far more ad  recall value than other mediums. Since marketers are moving to mobile to target  customers, Facebook is enthusiastically monetizing this shift.  Facebook is aggressively promoting  ?€?Live?€?   in order to boost its top line. It intends to  capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media  platforms. Earlier, Facebook had mentioned that video was emerging as a ?€?megatrend?€?  on the same lines like mobile. Last year, it  signed deals with media houses and Internet celebrities to churn out more content for its live platform and added a plethora of new  features to Facebook live. These include enabling broadcast for a group or event and at the same time allowing the audience to  respond to the live broadcast in real time through Live Reactions. Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.  As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more  video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Given the phenomenal growth in mobile ad business and video efforts, Facebook  has vastly outperformed the broader market. Facebook original programming might go live in mid August, per reports Over the past  one year, shares of Facebook have grown 31.5% compared with the industry's gain of 12.9%.   After opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers last year,  Instagram  has emerged as an important cash cow for Facebook.  Again, there were no exact numbers with regard to contribution from Instagram. It has expanded Dynamic ads to Instagram while  adding features like Live and Boomerang to Stories. The photo-sharing app now boasts over 700 million MAUs and over 400 million  DAUs. To bring more advertisers, Facebook said it has unveiled new tools to promote posts and evaluate business performance  directly within Instagram. The company also added that its latest feature ?€?Stories?€?  on Instagram has 250 million daily actives. In Jan  2017, Facebook said it will insert ads in Stories. Notably, it was subjected to severe ridicule when it acquired the snazzy photo  sharing app in 2012 for $1 billion.  Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus  are the other extremely prized possessions. Facebook is aggressively working on monetizing  the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ?€?conversational  commerce?€? are likely to be the strategies for  Messenger and WhatsApp. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the Messenger app, which has over 1 billion users, to  developers for creating chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. A few weeks  back, management had announced that it will be opening its subsidiary platform, Messenger, to worldwide advertisers, albeit for test  run purpose only. This underscores the company?€?s  efforts to monetize the platform.The  WhatsApp  acquisition (  not only  expanded the company?€?s mobile product lineup but also added a user base, which is predominantly young. At the same time, the  acquisition eliminated Facebook?€?s fastest-growing competitor in terms of user additions. With an estimated user base of over 1.3  billion, it remains one of most important businesses. To monetize the platform, the company has dropped the subscription fees and  will eventually bring ?€?conversational commerce?€? to the platform. WhatsApp now boasts 1 billion daily actives.  Oculus  will fuel the  company?€?s ambitious AR/VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another  $250 million investment to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper  standalone VR headset with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it had launched its VR headset, Rift. AI and AR/VR technology are  fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market will grow  to a whopping 143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion. Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two  separate units. While one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. The company has  roped in Hugo Barra to spearhead its VR efforts as well as head Oculus. Plus, few days back, Facebook said it will be spending over  $3 billion in the next 10 years on VR.  Facebook has a  strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow , which makes it an attractive stock for investors. The  company has cash and cash equivalents of $35.5 billion and recorded robust cash flow from operations of over $5.4 billion in the  second quarter of 2017. Free cash flow amounted to nearly $3.9 billion. The company continues to invest in developing its platform  and products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product  development and acquisitions in the future.  Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover?€?s advantage in this  market. The company?€?s  user base  continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve  engagement. However, as developed regions mature, Facebook has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of  South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Free Basics Initiative, which involves partnerships with local telecom networks to  subsidize some basic Internet services (including Facebook), so that users can get them free or at nominal rates, is expanding its  presence in these emerging regions. Africa, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has a little over 120 million who use Facebook. This  clearly indicates the immense scope for growth in the region even though it might take a lot of time. Also, the lack of physical  infrastructure has propelled the increasing use of mobile internet in the region, which is in tune with Facebook?€?s growth strategy.

Facebook is aggressively working on  monetizing the opportunities presented by its subsidiaries. Chatbots and ?€?conversational commerce?€? are likely to be the strategies  for Messenger and WhatsApp. The company remains pretty excited as it opened the Messenger app, which has over 1 billion users,  to developers for creating chatbots that would enable businesses to extend customer service and other transactions. Chatbots is the  new buzz word in the tech space. Chatbots could serve as a powerful strategy to monetize the platform. The  WhatsApp  acquisition  (  not only expanded the company?€?s mobile product line-up but also added a user base, which is predominantly young. At the  same time, the acquisition eliminated Facebook?€?s fastest-growing competitor in terms of user additions. With an estimated user  base of over 1.2 billion, it remains one of most important businesses. To monetize the platform, the company has dropped the  subscription fees and will eventually bring ?€?conversational commerce?€? to the platform.   Oculus  will fuel the company?€?s ambitious  AR/VR efforts. At its Oculus Developer conference held in October last year, Facebook announced another $250 million investment  to develop VR content ecosystem. It also announced some new products including Santa Cruz, a cheaper standalone VR headset  with inside-out-tracking. Earlier this year, it had launched its VR headset, Rift. AI and AR/VR technology are fast emerging as  lucrative business opportunities.  According to a recent IDC report, global revenues of the AR/VR market will grow to a whopping  143.3 billion by 2020, while that for AI would be close to $46 billion.Recently, Facebook split Oculus into two separate units. While  one division will focus on developing VR for mobile, the other one will focus on VR for PCs. The company has roped in Hugo Barra  to spearhead its VR efforts as well as head Oculus. Plus, few days back, Facebook said it will be spending over $3 billion in the next  10 years on VR.  Facebook has a  strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow , which makes it an attractive stock for investors. The  company has cash and cash equivalents of $32.3 billion and recorded robust cash flow from operations of over $5.1 billion in the  first quarter of 2017. Free cash flow amounted to nearly $3.8 billion. The company continues to invest in developing its platform and  products. We believe that its ability to generate strong cash flows will help it to make further investments in product development  and acquisitions in the future.  Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover?€?s advantage in this  market. The company?€?s  user base  continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve  engagement. But as developed regions mature, Facebook has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South  East Asia, Latin America and Africa. The Free Basics Initiative, which involves partnerships with local telecom networks to subsidize  some basic Internet services (including Facebook) so users can get them free or at nominal rates is expanding its presence in these  emerging regions.  Africa, with a population of over 1.2 billion, has a little over 120 million who use Facebook. This clearly indicates  the immense scope for growth in the region even though it might take a lot of time. Also, the lack of physical infrastructure has  propelled the increasing use of mobile Internet in the region, which is in tune with Facebook?€?s growth strategy. Facebook has  collaborated with France-based Eutelsat Communications to launch a satellite that would beam Internet in sub-Saharan African  regions. It is also testing Express Wi-Fi, and developing laser technology to move loads of data at super fast speed along with  Aquila, a solar powered aircraft to beam Internet from the sky.

187,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1.pdf",FB,1/2/2018,"Facebook maintains a  cautious stance  on revenue growth. The last reported quarter was no different. Since the past few  quarters, the company has maintained that ad revenues will continue to grow but will now face tougher year-over-year  comparisons. Ad load, which, so far has been a leading factor driving ad revenues, will now cease to be so in the coming quarters  and won?€?t be a big factor after mid-2017. Moreover, as the company continues to ramp up investments (Video, AR/VR and AI),  costs are already on the rise. Also, in the light of the recent Russia ads debacle, Facebook has said it will invest significantly in  ramping up security on the platform which will weigh down on the margins. Facebook planning to go on a hiring spree next year,  especially engineers and people involved in maintaining safety and security.   Facebook currently faces  stiff competition  from other big and small social media players. Although the company has started  distributing ads on other websites, we believe that Google continues to have a significant competitive edge due to its scale and  diversified product offering. Advertising remains Facebook?€?s major source of revenues and increasing competition can hurt its  top-line growth, going forward. New social media services like Snapchat and Pinterest offer tough competition as far as user  growth (especially teenagers) is concerned.   Although Facebook has significant growth opportunities in the emerging countries of South-East Asia and Africa, low internet  penetration in these regions may negatively affect its expansion. Further, while the company can be accessed from Hong Kong,  its usage has been  restricted  in mainland China due to excessive government regulations and censorship. This limits its growth  opportunities in the Asian region (Facebook?€?s fastest growing user base in terms of geography). The company is experiencing  better growth in international markets than in the U.S. However, average revenue per user (ARPU) is significantly low in these  regions compared with the U.S.   As Facebook hosts a huge amount of personal data, it has been under  constant scrutiny  from privacy groups and federal  agencies. This huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers. As a result, the company has been criticized for  allegedly selling personal data to advertisers in order to boost its top line. Although the company has denied any wrongdoing, we  believe that increasing scrutiny by regulators on its data handling practices remains a major concern, going forward. Recently, the  company ran into trouble with Brazilian law enforcement agencies involving its messaging service, WhatsApp, and in Germany  over antitrust concerns.  Moreover, Facebook finds itself increasingly at loggerheads with authorities across different countries  like Israel, who accuse the social media giant of repeatedly failing to co-operate with them on extremely sensitive matters.   Facebook will likely be impacted because of the  uncertainties relating to Brexit,  given the fact that it will have to re-define  everything from tax to data flow and privacy regulations for its operation in the U.K. Moreover, the company has its EU  headquarters in Ireland, through which, it was getting certain tax benefits. Now due to Brexit, Facebook will have to chalk out a  way to avoid paying higher taxes. It might also result in it having to relocate its headquarters (and some other facilities as well) in  order to continue getting the benefits of the EU bloc. ",sell
188,"Facebook, Inc._Attachment1.pdf",FB,6/1/2018,"Facebook has witnessed significant traction in  online and mobile advertising   spending in a short span of time. In 2017, Mobile ad revenues grew 56% over 2016.  The increase in mobile advertisement stems from the fact that mobile ads have far  more ad recall value than other mediums. Since marketers are moving to mobile to  target customers, Facebook is enthusiastically monetizing this shift.  Facebook intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing  video  viewing  on social media platforms. Earlier, the company had mentioned that video was  emerging as a ?€?megatrend?€? on the same lines like mobile. Online video is the most  lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than  its photo and text based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more  video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. The company launched Watch, a dedicated tab for video viewing, to achieve its  goal.  Instagram  has emerged as an important cash cow for Facebook after opening its ad platform to worldwide advertisers. Although no  exact numbers with regard to contribution from Instagram are shared, the growing adoption among advertisers is highly prominent.  To bring more advertisers (over 2 million and counting), Facebook said it has unveiled new tools to promote posts and evaluate  business performance directly within Instagram. ?€?Stories?€?  on Instagram has surpassed 300 million daily actives. The company is  now working on adding video chat, AR Camera Effects and a new Explore tab on Instagram soon.  Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus  are the other extremely prized possessions.

As  far as connectivity speeds are concerned, Facebook said that it has broken a few records. In case of wireless transfers, the  company has achieved a point-to-point data rate of 36 Gbps over 13 km with MMW technology and 80 Gbps using the optical cross-  link technology. We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook?€?s user-base in these regions in the long run.  Of all places,  India  deserves special mention in terms of user growth. The world?€?s  second largest populated country offers  tremendous potential. The number of mobile Internet users in the country, which has nearly 1.4 billion people, was 456 million in  December 2017. Per IAMAI report, given the availability of cheaper smartphones, faster connectivity and affordable services, the  figure is estimated to reach 478 million by June 2018. This bodes well for Facebook as most developed markets have reached  maturity. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine.

Since most of the offerings  are consumer discretionary products, demand is heavily dependent on macroeconomic conditions. As redemptions are high and  unused Groupons are low (revenues recognized upfront in daily deals, so an unused Groupon boosts the company?€?s revenues),  the transition is expected to negatively impact the top line in the near term.   Moreover, Groupon needs to continue spending on generating awareness about its offerings, which will drive up costs. Further,  the company is likely to incur sizeable expenses owing to the ongoing restructuring activities, which can weigh down on its  profitability. Additionally, aggressive investments for mobile, infrastructure and product development will continue to drive  operating expenses higher. Moreover, Groupon is investing quite a bit in the transition, which is expected to affect its near-term  financials. The company is also trying to revive a part of its daily deals business (through various offerings for merchants), which  was not a part of the restructuring program earlier.   Despite growing billings, Groupon is yet to earn significant profits since its inception. Moreover, revenue growth has slowed down  in the last couple of years. Furthermore, the new restructuring plan directly contradicts the company?€?s earlier business model per  which itundertook rapid international expansion at the cost of profits.

215,"Groupon, Inc._Attachment1.pdf",GRPN,11/6/2017,"Groupon?€?s business model makes it heavily dependent on daily deals, which is a major headwind. Since most of the offerings  are consumer discretionary products, demand is heavily dependent on macroeconomic conditions. As redemptions are high and  unused Groupons are low (revenues recognized upfront in daily deals, so an unused Groupon boosts the company?€?s revenues),  the transition is expected to negatively impact the top line in the near term.   Moreover, Groupon needs to continue spending on generating awareness about its offerings, which will drive up costs. Further,  the company is likely to incur sizeable expenses owing to the ongoing restructuring activities, which can weigh down on its  profitability. Additionally, aggressive investments for mobile, infrastructure and product development will continue to drive  operating expenses higher. Moreover, Groupon is investing quite a bit in the transition, which is expected to affect its near-term  financials. The company is also trying to revive a part of its daily deals business (through various offerings for merchants), which  was not a part of the restructuring program earlier.   Despite growing billings, Groupon is yet to earn significant profits since its inception. Moreover, revenue growth has slowed down  in the last couple of years. Furthermore, the new restructuring plan directly contradicts the company?€?s earlier business model per  which it undertook rapid international expansion at the cost of profits. As such, the increased uncertainties even cast a shadow on  the growth prospects from the increase in eCommerce spending on mobile devices.   Intensifying competition remains a major headwind, which is also likely to hurt profitability. The company expects competition in  eCommerce generally, and group buying in particular, to continue to increase. In addition, increasing presence of the social  media companies in the e-commerce space can also pose serious challenges to Groupon?€?s  recovery as merchants are  increasingly adopting these platforms to sell their products.

Also, management noted that its new offering Groupon+ has been well  accepted as the company is enhancing customer experience by investing in voucherless initiatives. This is expected to be a  catalyst going ahead. It is currently operating in more than 25 markets.   The company, through its e-Commerce platform, offers numerous deals that can be accessed by users anywhere and at anytime.  Users who search for these live deals generally tend to spend more. The company continues to invest in the platform to attract  new merchants, which will drive popularity. Earlier, Groupon revealed that it intends to reduce the number of discounted deals to  attract more merchants. Groupon?€?s long-term prospects rest upon its ability to offer more innovative products and build a broader  local eCommerce platform. The rollout of the company?€?s new card-linked platform, Groupon+ that replaces the voucher system  and makes discounting processes easy will be a tailwind in the long haul. ",sell
220,"Groupon, Inc._Attachment1.pdf",GRPN,4/22/2020,"Groupon is trying to change the consumer perception of its brand as it transitions from a deals  company to a marketplace company. For this, the company has outlined a new restructuring  plan with focus on three key areas namely, marketing, international and shopping. The  company now operates in 15 countries across the globe, down from 47 countries that it  operated in the beginning of 2015. The shopping business is also being restructured with the  lower-margin (specifically empty calories products) being de-emphasized to increase focus on  higher-margin healthy food offerings. Most importantly, Groupon is ramping up its marketing  activities especially in North America. Additionally, Groupon plans to reorganize its operations  over the next couple of years that will improve its overall operating efficiency and reduce  SG&A costs. In addition, the company is also working to improve its customer service experience while simultaneously enhancing the  services it offers to merchants.

The companies received FDA approval for a 72 mcg dose for CIC in  Jan 2017. The new dose was launched in Mar 2017. The launch of this lower dose strength is expected to boost prescriptions in  the large, heterogeneous adult CIC patient population.  Meanwhile, Ironwood and Allergan are developing two delayed release formulations of Linzess - delayed release-1 or DR1 and  delayed release-2 or DR2. A phase IIb study for DR1 is currently underway in patients with IBS-C. This second-generation  guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist candidate has the potential to provide greater and faster abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C  patients, expand the IBS-C and CIC markets, and extend patent protection to the mid-2030s. Data announced in Dec 2016  showed that the colonic formulation led to improvements in pain relief over Linzess. Phase III studies are expected to begin in the  second half of 2017. DR2 is being developed to improve abdominal pain relief in patients with additional gastrointestinal, or GI,  disorders where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom such as non-constipation subtypes of IBS.  Efforts are on to expand in ex-U.S. territories as well. Linzess was launched for IBS-C in Japan in Mar 2017, while a regulatory  filing has been submitted in China for the indication.

Ironwood has an agreement with  AstraZeneca for Linzess in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The collaborations have not only reduced the cost of developing the  drug, these also act as a source of revenue for Ironwood.

Pipeline Progress:  To capture the lucrative GI market, Ironwood is developing several candidates. IW-3718 looks interesting with a  phase IIb dose-ranging refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) study currently ongoing. Data from the study presented  in Jul 2017 showed that IW-3718 led to a significant reduction in heartburn severity in patients with uncontrolled GERD. Ironwood  believes that IW-3718 represents peak sales potential of more than $2 billion and expects to advance IW-3718 into phase III in the  second half of 2018.  Meanwhile, Ironwood is exploring soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators for the treatment of vascular and fibrotic diseases.  The company expects this platform to deliver multiple products, a number of which could generate peak sales exceeding $1 billion.

This second-generation  guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist candidate has the potential to provide greater and faster abdominal pain relief in adult IBS-C  patients, expand the IBS-C and CIC markets, and extend patent protection to the mid-2030s. Data announced in Dec 2016 showed  that the colonic formulation led to improvements in pain relief over Linzess. Phase III studies are expected to begin in the second  half of 2017. DR2 is being developed to improve abdominal pain relief in patients with additional gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders  where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom such as non-constipation subtypes of IBS.  Efforts are on to expand in ex-U.S. territories as well. Linzess was launched for IBS-C in Japan in Mar 2017, while a regulatory filing  has been submitted in China for the indication.  Linzess has the potential to be a blockbuster product. By the end of 2020, Ironwood expects annual sales of Linzess to cross $1  billion. The company is targeting at least three additional launches of Linzess by the end of 2018, starting with the lower dose (72  mcg) of the product in the U.S. in Mar 2017. Ironwood estimates that its IBS-C/CIC franchise, including Linzess and the colonic  release formulation (upon approval), may represent a peak U.S. sales opportunity of over $2 billion, with additional global potential.  Moreover, Linzess is well protected by patents and is unlikely to face generic competition before 2031. Ironwood and Allergan are  working to strengthen the patent further.  Strong Partnerships:  We are positive on Ironwood?€?s agreement with Allergan for the development and commercialization of Linzess  both in the U.S. and Europe. Given Allergan?€?s expertise and strong presence both in the U.S. and EU markets, we believe it is a  suitable partner for Ironwood. Ironwood is also co-promoting Viberzi (IBS-D) with Allergan in the U.S. and promoting Canasa  (ulcerative proctitis) and Delzicol (ulcerative colitis) in the U.S  The company also has a deal with Astellas for the development of Linzess in Japan. Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca  for Linzess in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The collaborations have not only reduced the cost of developing the drug, these also  act as a source of revenue for Ironwood. Additional partnerships in other territories will be a positive for the company.  Meanwhile, Ironwood has a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for exclusive U.S. rights to Zurampic and all products containing  lesinurad, including the fixed-dose combination of lesinurad and allopurinol. Zurampic was launched in Oct 2016. The fixed-dose  combination product, Duzallo, is under FDA review, and is expected to be launched by late 2017, if approved. The company  estimates that the uncontrolled gout market represents peak U.S. sales potential of more than $300 million.  Pipeline Progress:  To capture the lucrative GI market, Ironwood is developing several candidates. IW-3718 looks interesting with a  phase IIb dose-ranging refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) study currently ongoing with data expected in mid-2017.  Ironwood believes that IW-3718 represents peak sales potential of more than $2 billion.  Meanwhile, Ironwood is exploring soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators for the treatment of vascular and fibrotic diseases.  The company expects this platform to deliver multiple products, a number of which could generate peak sales exceeding $1 billion.  Phase II proof of concept studies with the two lead molecules, IW-1973 (diabetic hypertension) and IW-1701 (type II achalasia)  commenced in 2016. Data from the studies are expected in the second half of 2017.

Data from a phase IIb dose-ranging GERD study presented in July 2017 showed that IW-3718 led to a significant reduction in  heartburn severity in patients with uncontrolled GERD. Ironwood believes that IW-3718 represents peak sales potential of more than  $2 billion.  Meanwhile, Ironwood is exploring soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators for the treatment of vascular and fibrotic diseases.  The company expects this platform to deliver multiple products, a number of which could generate peak sales exceeding $1 billion.

The company is  progressing praliciguat in two phase II studies to evaluate it in diabetic nephropathy and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction  (HFpEF). Top-line from both the studies is expected in the second half of 2019. Meanwhile, two phase II studies will evaluate  olinciguat for treating sickle cell disease and achalasia. Data from the achalasia study is expected in the second half of 2018. The  candidate enjoys orphan drug designation in the United States for sickle cell disease.Meanwhile in its first quarter earnings call,  Ironwood announced that it will transfer its sGC pipeline to a separate entity, which will allow the company to have better focus on  development and strategic opportunity in future.

In 2017 so far, the company continued its rise  outperforming the industry with shares up 7.1%, compared to a 3.8% gain for the  industry.  Linzess Approval a Milestone:  The Aug 2012 FDA approval of Linzess was a major  milestone for Ironwood. Linzess was launched in Dec 2012. The company is focusing  on promoting Linzess to gastroenterologists and primary care physicians.  Ironwood is working on expanding managed care access to Linzess and lowering out-of-pocket costs. Moreover, CVS/Caremark  has granted Linzess an exclusive preferred position on its formulary, beginning Jan 1, 2016 and the company commenced a new  DTC campaign in Mar 2016. Linzess has been showing rapid sales and prescription growth backed by new patient additions, direct-  to-consumer (DTC) promotion, broad payer access and continued strong demand. In 2016, 2.7 million prescriptions of Linzess were  filled, representing growth of 27% year over year. The trend is expected to continue in 2017.  Linzess Label Expansion Efforts:  Ironwood and Allergan are looking to broaden Linzess?€? label by expanding the targeted patient  population and gaining approval for additional indications. The companies received FDA approval for a 72 mcg dose for CIC in Jan  2017 with the launch expected in early 2017. Approval for this lower dose strength would boost prescriptions in the large,  heterogeneous adult CIC patient population.  Meanwhile, a phase IIb study for a colonic formulation of Linzess is currently underway in patients with IBS-C. This second-  generation guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist candidate has the potential to provide greater and faster abdominal pain relief in  adult IBS-C patients, expand the IBS-C and CIC markets, and extend patent protection to the mid-2030s. Data announced in Dec  2016 showed that the colonic formulation led to improvements in pain relief over Linzess, supporting the advancement of the colonic  formulation to phase III development in 2017. Ironwood and Allergan are also developing linaclotide colonic release-2, or CR2, to  improve abdominal pain relief in patients with additional gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders where lower abdominal pain is a  predominant symptom such as non-constipation subtypes of IBS.  Efforts are on to expand in ex-U.S. territories as well. Linzess was approved for IBS-C in Japan in Dec 2016, while a regulatory filing  has been submitted in China for the indication.  Linzess has the potential to be a blockbuster product. By the end of 2020, Ironwood expects annual sales of Linzess to cross $1  billion. The company is targeting at least three additional launches of Linzess by the end of 2018, starting with the lower dose (72  mcg) of the product in the U.S. in early 2017. Ironwood estimates that its IBS-C/CIC franchise, including Linzess and the colonic  release formulation (upon approval), may represent a peak U.S. sales opportunity of over $2 billion, with additional global potential.  Moreover, Linzess is well protected by patents and is unlikely to face generic competition before 2031. Ironwood and Allergan are  working to strengthen the patent further.  Strong Partnerships:  We are positive on Ironwood?€?s agreement with Allergan for the development and commercialization of Linzess  both in the U.S. and Europe. Given Allergan?€?s expertise and strong presence both in the U.S. and EU markets, we believe it is a  suitable partner for Ironwood. Ironwood is also co-promoting Viberzi (IBS-D) with Allergan in the U.S.  The company also has a deal with Astellas for the development of Linzess in Japan. Ironwood has an agreement with AstraZeneca  for Linzess in China, Hong Kong and Macau. The collaborations have not only reduced the cost of developing the drug, these also  act as a source of revenue for Ironwood. Additional partnerships in other territories will be a positive for the company.  Meanwhile, Ironwood has a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca for exclusive U.S. rights to Zurampic and all products containing  lesinurad, including the fixed-dose combination of lesinurad and allopurinol. Zurampic was launched in Oct 2016. The fixed-dose  combination product, Duzallo, is under FDA review, and is expected to be launched by late 2017, if approved.

The collaborations have not only reduced the cost of developing the drug, these also  act as a source of revenue for Ironwood. Additional partnerships in other territories will be a positive for the company.  Pipeline Progress:  To capture the lucrative GI market, Ironwood is developing several candidates. In June 2018, the company  initiated two phase III studies to evaluate IW-3718 in patients with persistent refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Data from a phase IIb dose-ranging GERD study presented in July 2017 showed that IW-3718 led to a significant reduction in  heartburn severity in patients with uncontrolled GERD. Ironwood believes that IW-3718 represents peak sales potential of more than  $2 billion.  Meanwhile, Ironwood is exploring soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators for the treatment of vascular and fibrotic diseases.

In September 2018, Merrimack secured  a $5-million milestone from Shire following the sale of Onivyde in the first major non-European and non-Asian country.  Promising Candidates in Pipeline:  Merrimack is currently working on developing its only early-stage pipeline candidate MM-310  for the treatment of solid tumors. A phase I study on MM-310 is under way to evaluate the candidate?€?s safety in patients with solid  tumors and also identify its maximum tolerated dose. However, after treating the first 14 patients in the dose escalation program, the  study was amended to test an alternative dosing schedule. The company plans to report safety data from the study during the first  quarter of 2019.  Merrimack intends to advance its two preclinical candidates ?€? an immuno-oncology program, MM-401 (an agonistic antibody  targeting a novel immuno-oncology target, TNFR , and MM-201 (a highly stabilized agonist-Fc fusion protein targeting death  receptors 4 and  .  Prioritizing R&D Efforts:  Merrimack undertook a restructuring move to prioritize its R&D focused on a set of oncology products and  to strengthen its cash runway over the next two years. As part of this move, the company has reduced its headcount by 22%. This  will lead to the elimination of over $200 million in expected costs over the next two years. The company will also invest $175 million  to develop its streamlined oncology pipeline. This move will allow the company to strategically align its pipeline with core capabilities  and prioritize the ongoing clinical development efforts. It will also help to improve its financial flexibility. Merrimack is planning to lay  off workforce by 60% as part of its corporate restructuring planpost which, the company expects to have approximately 27  employees.This reduction in headcount is expected to be completed by February 2019.  Promising Cash Position:  Merrimack expects its current financial resources along with anticipated milestone payments from Shire  to be sufficient to fund its operations at the estimated spending rates through the second half of 2019.

Prioritizing R&D Efforts:  Merrimack undertook a restructuring move to prioritize its R&D focused on a set of oncology products and  to strengthen its cash runway over the next two years. As part of this move, the company has reduced its headcount by 22%. This  will lead to the elimination of over $200 million in expected costs over the next two years. The company will also invest $175 million  to develop its streamlined oncology pipeline. This move will allow the company to strategically align its pipeline with core capabilities  and prioritize the ongoing clinical development efforts. It will also help to improve its financial flexibility. Merrimack is planning to lay  off workforce by 60% as part of its corporate restructuring planpost which, the company expects to have approximately 27  employees.This reduction in headcount is expected to be completed by February 2019.  Promising Cash Position:  Merrimack expects its current financial resources along with anticipated milestone payments from Shire  to be sufficient to fund its operations at the estimated spending rates through the second half of 2019.

In 2019,  sales to two of its customers each accounted for 10% or more of the company?€?s revenues. No other distributor accounted for greater than  10% of revenues in 2019. Therefore, any loss in orders from a major customer could impact its sales figure.   Exposure to the consumer end-market could result in pricing pressure. NXP has exposure to the consumer end market through the mobile  segment. Given the exposure to this end market, NXP potentially faces significant pricing pressure for products sold for mobile phones and  other consumer applications.   NXP is subject to changing laws and regulations as it based in the Netherlands. The geopolitical environment makes it quite uncertain how  the regulatory bodies will handle companies operating in different countries. Thus, any change in tax laws or tariffs could impact its  financial results.   The company?€?s balance sheet is highly leveraged. It has always had a good amount of debt on the balance sheet.

301,"Palo Alto Networks, Inc._Attachment1(2).pdf",PANW,5/23/2017,"The  decelerating revenue growth trend  makes us slightly cautious about Palo Alto's near-term performance. Notably, the  company has witnessed over 50% growth in quarterly revenues for nearly two years except in the past two quarters. During the  first quarter of fiscal 2017 and second quarter of fiscal 2017, the year-over-year growth rates were 34% and 26.3%, respectively.  Moreover, Palo Alto?€?s  revenue growth guidance range of 17% to 20% for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 has increased our  concerns. Furthermore, the company?€?s billings growth rate of 22% during the second quarter were also much lower than the  previous two quarters?€? growth rates of 33% and 45%.   Near-term prospects for Palo Alto are not promising as  changing customer spending behavior  has recently hit several other  players in this space. For the past few months, various competitors in the cyber security space noticed that the companies have  been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time, instead  of making a single large investment. This makes us slightly cautious about the company?€?s near-term performance.   The recent forecast for  worldwide IT spending  by Gartner raises concerns about Palo Alto?€?s  near-term performance. The  research firm has lowered its forecast on IT spending for 2017. The recent forecast 2.7% year over year growth in IT spending is  0.2% lower than its previous projection of 2.9% growth. Gartner now expects IT spending in 2017 will be approximately $3.46  trillion. This was the third time in 2016 that the firm has lowered its global IT spending forecast for 2017. Although the research  firm has not mentioned any cut in IT security spending, we believe that soft IT spending trend could have a negative impact on  this segment as well.   Palo Alto faces stiff  competition  from several big and small players in the security application market. Further, over the past few  years, the demand for IT security has been on the rise driven by increasing awareness and cyber attacks, making the market  more attractive for new players. Also, there are some established players in the adjacent markets like Cisco and Juniper that can  cross sell security products and include security into their existing product lines, further intensifying competition in the space.  Therefore, companies must deliver prompt and advanced technologies to suit customer requirements and expedite product  launch to stay afloat.   To survive in the highly competitive cyber security market, each player must continually invest in broadening its capabilities. Over  the past few years, Palo Alto has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by increasing the  sales force. This has negatively impacted its operating margins. Furthermore, though the company foresees these investments to  garner benefit over the long run, we note that there is  uncertainty about the payback period . ",sell

As a result, organizations have in-depth visibility  into all traffic and applications which help them to control usage, content, risks and  cyber threats at the user level. Therefore, Palo Alto?€?s  security platforms simplify  security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone  security appliances and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership thereby giving the organization a competitive  edge.  Palo Alto has made  strategic acquisitions  to boost growth. In Feb 2017, Palo Alto completed the buyout of LightCyber for $105  million. The acquisition has expanded the company?€?s Next-Generation Security Platform. Over the last few years, the company also  completed three important buyouts to broaden its portfolio and global reach. In 2014, the company took over Morta Security and  Israel-based Cyvera which expanded its product portfolio as well as the customer base. The company in May 2015 acquired  CirroSecure ?€? a start-up which specializes in guarding Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. CirroSecure's resources and  expertise has helped Palo Alto in expanding the functionality of its enterprise security platform and guard the SaaS collaboration  products of Salesforce.com, Google Drive, Box and Dropbox better.  With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has  enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. On the flipside, however, it has become all the more necessary for  organizations to enforce data security measures. To capitalize on this particular emerging opportunity, Palo Alto launched  GlobalProtect , a next-generation network firewall security product which helps enterprises protect iOS and Android-based mobile  devices. With this, the company mainly focuses on organizations that follow predetermined BYOD policies as the product detects  device, application and in-network threats. Apart from this, the company provides real-time mobile security and intelligence to any  organization's existing security and mobility infrastructure.  Palo Alto has made  strategic partnerships  to expedite growth. The company formed the NextWave Technology Partner Program  under which an organization can join as strategic or integration partner. Under this program, Palo Alto integrates its solutions with its  partners and ensures that the combined products are working seamlessly, thereby allowing organizations to be more mobile, nimble  and collaborative. Over the last one year, it has expanded its strategic partnership with VMware to address cloud and mobile  security needs of organizations. Apart from this, Palo Alto has made strategic alliance with Aruba Networks to offer security  solutions tailored for mobile users. Furthermore, with another partnership with Splunk, Palo Alto is offering solutions to effectively  coordinate detection, incident investigation, and response for advanced threats. Moreover, by integrating its solutions with Citrix, the  company offers security solutions to cloud networking platforms. These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo Alto  thereby boosting the top line.  The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals has  led to a tremendous surge in demand for cloud computing software and applications. This trend, on the other hand, has made it  necessary for companies to enforce stricter data security measures. Therefore, looking at the industry?€?s  trends, Palo Alto is  currently  focusing on cloud-based protection services . The company currently offers a subscription-based cloud protection  service ?€?  WildFire ?€?  which helps end-customers in identifying malware on any network and takes preventive measures  automatically. Moreover, Palo Alto has launched two more subscription-based services ?€? AutoFocus and Aperture ?€? which have  expanded its cloud protection capabilities.  Palo Alto is  gaining customer accounts and increasing penetration of existing customers , thereby driving revenue growth.  During the fourth quarter, the company added nearly 3,000 customers, bringing the total to over 42,500 worldwide. It is to be noted  that in each of the last 22 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers. This vast customer base presents the company  an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Moreover, any product refresh brings in additional dollars as every  enterprise attempts to keep their threat management infrastructure updated. These factors, in turn, support Palo Alto?€?s top line.  Palo Alto is currently focusing on selling more  subscription-based services . This unique business model is helping it to generate  stable revenues while expanding margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross-margin business (approximately 80%)  compared with the hardware-centric model. Notably, the company garners nearly 23% of the total revenue from these services,  which has helped it to retain its gross margin above 70% over the last few quarters. We believe that the strategy will continue to  improve the company?€?s top line and bottom line. Palo Alto has been witnessing tremendous customer growth for its subscription-  based services like WildFire and Trap. The WildFire customer base reached over 19,000 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017  compared with 17,000 at the end of third-quarter. Further, the company?€?s  subscription-based services ?€? AutoFocus, Aperture,  Traps and Virtual continue to witness solid growth. We believe that continued focus on subscription-based products and services  and product upgrades will boost the company?€?s top line.   Palo Alto has a  strong balance sheet with ample liquidity  and no debt obligations. Cash and short-term investments were $1.375  billion as of Jul 31, 2017, which translates to approximately 40% of the total assets.

Therefore, looking at the industry?€?s  trends, Palo Alto is  currently  focusing on cloud-based protection services . The company currently offers a subscription-based cloud protection  service ?€?  WildFire ?€?  which helps end-customers in identifying malware on any network and takes preventive measures  automatically. Moreover, Palo Alto has launched several new subscription-based services in the last few months ?€? AutoFocus,  Aperture, GlobalProtect cloud service and Logging Service ?€? which have expanded its cloud protection capabilities.  Palo Alto is  gaining customer accounts and increasing penetration of existing customers , thereby driving revenue growth.  During the first quarter, the company added over 3,000 customers, bringing the total to over 51,000 worldwide. It is to be noted that  in each of the last 24 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers. This vast customer base presents the company an  opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Moreover, any product refresh brings in additional dollars as every  enterprise attempts to keep their threat management infrastructure updated. These factors, in turn, support Palo Alto?€?s top line.  Palo Alto is currently focusing on selling more  subscription-based services . This unique business model is helping it to generate  stable revenues while expanding margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross-margin business (approximately 80%)  compared with the hardware-centric model. Notably, the company garners nearly 23% of the total revenue from these services,  which has helped it to retain its gross margin above 70% over the last few quarters. We believe that the strategy will continue to  improve the company?€?s top line and bottom line. Palo Alto has been witnessing tremendous customer growth for its subscription-  based services like WildFire and Trap. The WildFire customer base reached over 19,000 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017  compared with 17,000 at the end of third-quarter. Further, the company?€?s  subscription-based services ?€? AutoFocus, Aperture,  Traps and Virtual continue to witness solid growth. We believe that continued focus on subscription-based products and services  and product upgrades will boost the company?€?s top line.   Palo Alto has a  strong balance sheet with ample liquidity  and no debt obligations. Cash and short-term investments were $1.375  billion as of Jul 31, 2017, which translates to approximately 40% of the total assets. Moreover, during fiscal 2017, the company  generated $868.5 million of cash flow from operational activities. Notably, the company has been able to regularly increase its cash  and marketable securities which reached $1.375 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 from $322.6 million at the end of fiscal 2012.

Consequently, cyber security has become a mission-  critical, high-profile requirement. Palo Alto is growing rapidly in this space on the back  of  its innovative  next-generation security platforms .

As a result, organizations have in-depth visibility  into all traffic and applications which help them to control usage, content, risks and  cyber threats at the user level. Therefore, Palo Alto?€?s  security platforms simplify  security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone  security appliances and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership thereby giving the organization a competitive  edge.  Palo Alto has made  strategic acquisitions  to boost growth. In Feb 2017, Palo Alto completed the buyout of LightCyber for $105  million. The acquisition has expanded the company?€?s Next-Generation Security Platform. Over the last few years, the company also  completed three important buyouts to broaden its portfolio and global reach. In 2014, the company took over Morta Security and  Israel-based Cyvera which expanded its product portfolio as well as the customer base. The company in May 2015 acquired  CirroSecure ?€? a start-up which specializes in guarding Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. CirroSecure's resources and  expertise has helped Palo Alto in expanding the functionality of its enterprise security platform and guard the SaaS collaboration  products of Salesforce.com, Google Drive, Box and Dropbox better. Moreover, the company expects to expand its endpoint  detection and response (EDR) capabilities with the latest acquisition of Secdo.  With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has  enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. On the flipside, however, it has become all the more necessary for  organizations to enforce data security measures. To capitalize on this particular emerging opportunity, Palo Alto launched  GlobalProtect , a next-generation network firewall security product which helps enterprises protect iOS and Android-based mobile  devices. With this, the company mainly focuses on organizations that follow predetermined BYOD policies as the product detects  device, application and in-network threats. Apart from this, the company provides real-time mobile security and intelligence to any  organization's existing security and mobility infrastructure.  Palo Alto has made  strategic partnerships  to expedite growth. The company formed the NextWave Technology Partner Program  under which an organization can join as strategic or integration partner. Under this program, Palo Alto integrates its solutions with its  partners and ensures that the combined products are working seamlessly, thereby allowing organizations to be more mobile, nimble  and collaborative. Over the last one year, it has expanded its strategic partnership with VMware to address cloud and mobile  security needs of organizations. Apart from this, Palo Alto has made strategic alliance with Aruba Networks to offer security  solutions tailored for mobile users. Furthermore, with another partnership with Splunk, Palo Alto is offering solutions to effectively  coordinate detection, incident investigation, and response for advanced threats. Moreover, by integrating its solutions with Citrix, the  company offers security solutions to cloud networking platforms.

Near-term prospects for Palo Alto are not promising as customer changing behavior has recently hit several other players in this  space. For the past few months, various competitors in the cyber security space noticed that the companies have been breaking  their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time, instead of making a  single large investment. This makes us slightly cautious about the company?€?s near-term performance.   Palo Alto faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Further, over the past few  years, the demand for IT security has been on the rise driven by increasing awareness and cyber attacks, making the market  more attractive for new players. Also, there are some established players in the adjacent markets like Cisco and Juniper that can  cross sell security products and include security into their existing product lines, further intensifying competition in the space.  Therefore, companies must deliver prompt and advanced technologies to suit customer requirements and expedite product  launch to stay afloat.   To survive in the highly competitive cyber security market, each player must continually invest in broadening its capabilities. Over  the past few years, Palo Alto has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by increasing the  sales force. This has negatively impacted its operating margins. Furthermore, though the company foresees these investments to  garner benefit over the long run, we note that there is uncertainty about the payback period.

Near-term prospects for Palo Alto are not promising as customer changing behavior has recently hit several other players in this  space. For the past few months, various competitors in the cyber security space noticed that the companies have been breaking  their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time, instead of making a  single large investment. This makes us slightly cautious about the company?€?s near-term performance.   Palo Alto faces stiff competition from several big and small players in the security application market. Further, over the past few  years, the demand for IT security has been on the rise driven by increasing awareness and cyber attacks, making the market  more attractive for new players. Also, there are some established players in the adjacent markets like Cisco and Juniper that can  cross sell security products and include security into their existing product lines, further intensifying competition in the space.  Therefore, companies must deliver prompt and advanced technologies to suit customer requirements and expedite product  launch to stay afloat.   To survive in the highly competitive cyber security market, each player must continually invest in broadening its capabilities. Over  the past few years, Palo Alto has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by increasing the  sales force. This has negatively impacted its operating margins. Furthermore, though the company foresees these investments to  garner benefit over the long run, we note that there is uncertainty about the payback period.

Consequently, cyber security has become a mission-  critical, high-profile requirement. Palo Alto is growing rapidly in this space on the back  of  its innovative  next-generation security platforms . The company?€?s  security  platforms have innovative traffic classification engine that helps it in identifying network  traffic by application, user and content. As a result, organizations have in-depth visibility  into all traffic and applications which help them to control usage, content, risks and  cyber threats at the user level. Therefore, Palo Alto?€?s  security platforms simplify  security infrastructure for organizations by eliminating the need for multiple, stand-alone  security appliances and software products. This reduces the total cost of ownership thereby giving the organization a competitive  edge.  Palo Alto has made  strategic acquisitions  to boost growth. Palo Alto recently announced the buyout of LightCyber for $105 million.  The  acquisition will expand the company?€?s  Next-Generation Security Platform. Over the last few years, the company  also completed three important buyouts to broaden its portfolio and global reach. Most recently, the company acquired CirroSecure  ?€? a start-up which specializes in guarding Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. CirroSecure's resources and expertise will  help Palo Alto in expanding the functionality of its enterprise security platform and guard the SaaS collaboration products of  Salesforce.com, Google Drive, Box and Dropbox better. We believe that this acquisition will not only expand its capabilities but the  customer base as well. Additionally, last year, the company took over Morta Security and Israel-based Cyvera which further  expanded its product portfolio as well as the customer base.  With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, which has  enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access. On the flipside, however, it has become all the more necessary for  organizations to enforce data security measures. To capitalize on this particular emerging opportunity, Palo Alto launched  GlobalProtect , a next-generation network firewall security product which helps enterprises protect iOS and Android-based mobile  devices. With this, the company will mainly focus on organizations that follow predetermined BYOD policies as the product detects  device, application and in-network threats. Apart from this, the company provides real-time mobile security and intelligence to any  organization's existing security and mobility infrastructure.  Palo Alto has made  strategic partnerships  to expedite growth. The company formed the NextWave Technology Partner Program  under which an organization can join as strategic or integration partner. Under this program, Palo Alto integrates its solutions with its  partners and ensures that the combined products are working seamlessly, thereby allowing organizations to be more mobile, nimble  and collaborative. Last year, it expanded its strategic partnership with VMware to address mobile security needs as more and more  organizations are adopting BYOD policy. Per the deal, both the companies have integrated their enterprise security and mobile  management technologies to provide a unique combination of mobile device management (MDM) with advanced threat prevention  solution to secure enterprise BYOD support. Apart from this, Palo Alto has made strategic alliance with Aruba Networks to offer  security solutions tailored for mobile users. Furthermore, with another partnership with Splunk, Palo Alto is offering solutions to  effectively coordinate detection, incident investigation, and response for advanced threats. Moreover, by integrating its solutions with  Citrix, the company offers security solutions to cloud networking platforms. These strategic partnerships bring in customers for Palo  Alto thereby boosting the top line.  The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals has  led to a tremendous surge in demand for cloud computing software and applications. This trend, on the other hand, has made it  necessary for companies to enforce stricter data security measures. Therefore, looking at the industry?€?s  trends, Palo Alto is  currently  focusing on cloud-based protection services . The company currently offers a subscription-based cloud protection  service ?€?  WildFire ?€?  which helps end-customers in identifying malware on any network and takes preventive measures  automatically. Moreover, Palo Alto has recently launched two more subscription-based services ?€? AutoFocus and Aperture ?€? which  have expanded its cloud protection capabilities.  Palo Alto is  gaining customer accounts and increasing penetration of existing customers , thereby driving revenue growth.  During the first quarter, the company added over 1,500 customers, bringing the total to approximately 35,500 worldwide, which also  includes over 85 of the Fortune 100, more than 70% of the Fortune 500 and higher than 55% of the Global 2000 companies. It is to  be noted that in each of the last 19 quarters, Palo Alto has added at least 1,000 customers. This vast customer base presents the  company an opportunity to upsell products within its installed user base. Moreover, any product refresh brings in additional dollars  as every enterprise attempts to keep their threat management infrastructure updated. These factors, in turn, support Palo Alto?€?s top  line.  Palo Alto is currently focusing on selling more  subscription-based services . This unique business model is helping it to generate  stable revenues while expanding margins. Subscription-based service is a high gross-margin business (approximately 80%)  compared with the hardware-centric model. Notably, the company garners nearly 23% of the total revenue from these services,  which has helped it to retain its gross margin above 70% over the last few quarters. We believe that the strategy will continue to  improve the company?€?s top line and bottom line. Palo Alto has been witnessing tremendous customer growth for its subscription-  based services like WildFire and Trap. The WildFire customer base reached over 14,000 in the first-quarter fiscal 2017 compared  with 12,500 at the end of fourth-quarter fiscal 2016. Further, the company?€?s subscription-based services ?€? AutoFocus, Aperture,  Traps and Virtual continue to witness solid growth.

335,"Proofpoint, Inc._Attachment1(2).pdf",PFPT,5/10/2018,"The demand for  cyber security  is on the rise. The long list of data breaches has brought to  light the fact that a company?€?s  financial well-being, brands and reputation are today  increasingly exposed to sophisticated cyber threats. The advent of cloud computing and the  idea of sharing resources to lower cost has further increased demand for adequate security  policies, protocols and products. Consequently, cyber security is becoming a mission-critical,  high-profile requirement. As a result, companies are allotting increasing portions of their IT  budgets for security solutions. Per Gartner?€?s new report, worldwide spending on IT security will  reach $96 billion in 2018 from $89 billion in 2017. Another report from Markets and Markets  suggests that cyber security market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% in the 2017-2022  period. These predictions bode well for Proofpoint, which has a diversified product portfolio for  large and mid-sized organizations to defend, protect, archive, and govern their sensitive data.  Furthermore, Proofpoint has partnered with Palo Alto Networks, CyberArk, IBM, Imperva and  Intel to  provide best-in-class cyber  security  solutions to  customers. Proofpoint?€?s  rich  experience in the security space and continued delivery of mission-critical solutions will help it to grow its market share.  Proofpoint has made strategic  acquisitions  to expedite growth. Most recently in February 2018, the company signed a definitive  agreement to buy Wombat Security Technologies, Inc. In 2017, the company made two important buyouts ?€? Cloudmark which is  specialized in providing security protection for messaging services and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions. In 2016,  the company acquired FireLayers, an innovator in cloud security. The acquisition has helped Proofpoint in extending its Targeted  Attack Protection (TAP) solution to SaaS applications and protects these from advanced malware. Same year, it acquired the Email  Fraud Protection (EFP) business unit from Return Path. The integration of Return Path?€?s EFP business has helped Proofpoint to  further enhance its Business Email Compromise (BEC) capabilities. In 2015, the company made two important acquisitions ?€?  Emerging Threats, a leading provider of advanced threat intelligence, and Socialware, a leading provider of social media compliance  solutions. Apart from this, last year, Proofpoint also purchased certain assets from Marble Security Inc. and Emerging Threats Pro,  LLC. In 2014, the company acquired two businesses ?€? Nexgate Inc. and NetCitadel Inc., while in 2013 it purchased four companies  ?€? Sendmail, Armorize Technologies, Abaca Technology and Mail Distiller. We believe that the aforementioned acquisitions have not  only expanded Proofpoint?€?s product portfolio but also its customer and revenue base.  Social media networks have made the world a smaller place and though it has been here since a decade only, it?€?s difficult to  imagine life without it. As social media is now being used for various personal, professional and business purposes, it is increasingly  becoming the prime target of cyber attacks. According to Proofpoint, on an average, companies have over 300 brand-owned social  media accounts on different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest and others.  While each of these accounts provides an opportunity to strengthen the connection of the brand with its audience, there is also a  downside. The accounts are vulnerable to security breaches. Also, heightened regulatory requirements for brand-owned accounts  pose the risk of violations and fines. Therefore, in an effort to tap the growing opportunity in this space, Proofpoint acquired Nexgate  a pioneer in security and compliance solutions for social media communication channels, in 2014. With this acquisition, the company  forayed into the  social media security and compliance  space. Proofpoint further enhanced its capabilities in this space by  acquiring Socialware, a leading provider of social media compliance solutions, in 2015.

In 2017, the company made two important buyouts ?€? Cloudmark which is  specialized in providing security protection for messaging services and Weblife.io, a leader in browser isolation solutions.

Emerging Threats, a leading provider of advanced threat intelligence, and Socialware, a leading provider of social  media compliance solutions. Apart from this, last year, Proofpoint also purchased certain assets from Marble Security Inc. and  Emerging Threats Pro, LLC. In 2014, the company acquired two businesses ?€? Nexgate Inc. and NetCitadel Inc., while in 2013 it  purchased four companies ?€? Sendmail, Armorize Technologies, Abaca Technology and Mail Distiller.

Social media networks have made the world a smaller place and though it has been here since a decade only, it?€?s difficult to  imagine life without it. As social media is now being used for various personal, professional and business purposes, it is  increasingly becoming the prime target of cyber attacks. According to Proofpoint, on an average, companies have over 300  brand-owned social media accounts on different platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Instagram,  Pinterest and others. While each of these accounts provides an opportunity to strengthen the connection of the brand with its  audience, there is also a downside. The accounts are vulnerable to security breaches. Also, heightened regulatory requirements  for brand-owned accounts pose the risk of violations and fines. Therefore, in an effort to tap the growing opportunity in this space,  Proofpoint acquired Nexgate a pioneer in security and compliance solutions for social media communication channels, in 2014.

357,"Proofpoint, Inc._Attachment1.pdf",PFPT,4/30/2019,"To survive in the highly competitive cyber security market, each player must continually invest in broadening its capabilities. Over  the past few years, Proofpoint has invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by increasing the  sales force. This remains a drag on the company?€?s  bottom-line results. Furthermore, though the company foresees these  investments to garner benefit over the long run, we note that there is uncertainty about the payback period.   Near-term prospects for Proofpoint are not promising as changing customer spending behavior has recently hit several other  players in this space. For the past few months, various competitors in the cyber security space noticed that the companies have  been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time, instead  of making a single large investment. Therefore, we are slightly cautious about the company?€?s near-term prospects.   Proofpoint faces competition from numerous big and small companies in the security application market. As Internet threats and  attacks increase, stiff competition will follow suit. Competing firms must deliver prompt and advanced technologies to suit  customer requirements and expedite product introduction in order to survive. Moreover, we believe that Proofpoint?€?s dominance  could be challenged by new entrants. This could lead the company to resort to competitive pricing to maintain and capture market  share.   Proofpoint expects the inorganic revenue contributions in 2018 to lead to challenging year-over-year comparison in 2019. The  company anticipates additional headwinds in the coming year due to adoption of ASC 606 and no contribution from Cloudmark's  OEM business. Moreover, the company anticipates the first quarter of 2019 to witness a relatively low year-over-year growth rate,  which makes us anxious.

The company operates  primarily in emerging markets where overall online advertising spending and internet use penetration is comparatively lower than the  developed countries. Moreover, traditional modes of advertising such as television and radio are still preferable than the online internet  advertising in most of the developing countries. This remains a headwind. Notably, any customer or group of customers of the company  have not even accounted for more than 10% of its revenues since 2015.   Yandex operates primarily in Russia; consequently, its financial and operating activities are exposed to economic conditions of the country.  Hence, any unfavorable economic situation is bound to impact the company?€?s fundamentals significantly. Russia?€?s high dependency on  oil and gas exports makes its economy prone to the fluctuations in the world oil and gas prices. The economy witnessed a severe  downturn in 2014 and 2015 due to a sharp fall in oil prices and this led to a substantial decline in the country?€?s stock market and  depreciation of ruble. Additionally, strict tax laws in Russia remain major concerns as the company has recorded $5 million of  unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities. Now if the company plans to enter the global market, it will face a tough competition from Google  which already poses a stiff challenge in Russia.   Notably, the company is trading at premium in terms of Price/Earnings. Currently, Yandex has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 32.57, which  compares unfavorably with what the industry witnessed over the last year.
